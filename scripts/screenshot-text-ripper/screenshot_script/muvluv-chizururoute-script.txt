【Takeru】「...Oww... You didn't have to hit me so hard...」

【Sumika】「Oh, shut up... It's your own fault, Takeru-chan. You were the one being a perv!」

【Takeru】「I already told you, I couldn't help it! It was just a reflex!」

【Sumika】「Want me to help you remember?」【Takeru】「What — so you want me to touch them, then? Make up your mind already.」【Takeru】「...Look. I'm sorry, alright...?」【Takeru】「...Psych! Did you really think I'd listen to you that easily!?!?」【Sumika】「Owieee!!!」【Takeru】「Since when have you been so high and mighty!? Hm!? You've got a lot of nerve talking to me like that, punk!」【Sumika】「You're the one who felt me up in the first place!」【Takeru】「Get over it already!!」【Sumika】「You squeezed them! You squeezed them! You squeezed them! You squeezed them!」【Sumika】「Yeowch!!」【Takeru】「Save it for when you actually get some real boobs! A real rack has some volume, some weight, some...」

────Ack!

【Sumika】「Idiooooot!!」【Takeru】「Gagariiin!!」【Takeru】「Jeez... It's nothing worth hitting people over...」【Takeru】「Ugh... I'm still feeling shaky...」【Sumika】「You weren't kidding about the short-term memory loss. We're helping your parents pick up some things they need for their vacation!」【Takeru】「Whaaat!?」【Takeru】「It's their own fault for telling me on such short notice. And why'd they choose 'Unparalleled Cold: The Full Siberian Experience,' anyway!? Are they trying to kill themselves!?」【Sumika】「That's what your mom was telling me.」【Takeru】「...So, what's on our shopping list?」【Sumika】「It's definitely something you'd want to have on the Aegean Sea, though.」【Takeru】「......」【Takeru】「Oh well. Let's not worry about it.」【Takeru】「Those two have this serious, fundamental inability to communicate. Let this be a lesson to them.」【Sumika】「Judging how you turned out, I can kinda believe that...」【Takeru】「Don't just insult people and think you can get away with it.」【Train Announcer】「Tachibana district... Now arriving at the Tachibana district. The exits will be...」【Takeru】「...C'mon, we've gotta go!!」【Sumika】「Aaah! W-Wait for meee...!」【Sumika】「Takeru-chaaan, help me carry some of this stuff...」【Sumika】「Hell-looo? These are really heavy...!」【Sumika】「Oh, okay... Sounds good to me...」【Takeru】「I had rice with chestnuts in it the other day. That was pretty good... I just love that subtle seasoning, it really hits the spot...」【Sumika】「Huh? I ate some just the other day.」【Takeru】「What!?」【Takeru】「GHACK!!」【Sumika】「A-Are you okay!?」

Just... mushrooms...? "JUST" mushrooms, she says!?【Sumika】「It's not like they're a rare delicacy or anything.」【Sumika】「Yeah.」【Takeru】「For real!?」【Sumika】「Okay then, I'll call my mom and let her know.
So, what do you feel like eating?」【Takeru】「Sweet!!
Then, for starters, I think we've gotta have fried rice...」【Takeru】「And then... how about some barbeque?
That'd be really good, too...」【Sumika】「Oh yeah? What's that?」【Takeru】「You've never heard of it?
You take a dobin — a kind of teapot — put some sea breams, shrimp, matsutake and sauces into it, and then boil the whole thing.」【Takeru】「Well, if you've already got matsutake mushrooms, the king of the mountains, then the only fitting complement would be the treasures of the sea, don't you think?」【Sumika】「No, miso.」【Sumika】「And then, let's see... Oh, yeah! We can sauté it with some spinach, bacon and eggs. It's really good like that, too...」...You can't be serious.
Dude... What you're talking about... Those are just...【Takeru】「RRGHAAAH!!!」【Sumika】「Whoa!! Wh-What's the big deal!?」【Sumika】「Owie!!」【Takeru】「Are you an idiot!? Or just plain dumb!?!?」【Sumika】「What was that for!? That hurts, you know!!」【Takeru】「The ones you're thinking of... They're just plain old shimeji mushrooms...」

【Sumika】「I thought I told you... that HURTS!!!!」

【Sumika】「...Heeey, you still alive?」【Sumika】「Hey, come on. Get up already.
There's a crowd gathering.」【Sumika】「......」【Sumika】「This is kinda embarrassing, so...
I'm gonna head home, okay?」【Sumika】「Ah...」【Takeru】「Suuumiiikaaaaa!!」【Takeru】「...I can't believe... you'd just leave me here to die...」【Takeru】「But Sumika...」【Takeru】「No, I already told you, those aren't...」【Takeru】「......」Mr. Kagami... Mrs. Kagami... Where did you go wrong...? What the hell happened in Sumika's past...?I mean, how else could she have gone so long without realizing this!?【Sumika】「Whaaat!? But what about lunch?」【Takeru】「Shut up! I said I'm going home, and that's that!」【Takeru】「Stop being such a baby!」【Takeru】「Have fun with that. Bye.」【Sumika】「......」

......

【Takeru】「Jeez... Don't just stand there pouting with your hands full.」【Sumika】「But...!」【Takeru】「Don't push it. You're the one forcing me to do this. I'll look like the bad guy here otherwise.
But you're buying — you got that?」【Sumika】「Your mom already gave me some money!」【Takeru】「Where else!? Over to Sky Temple, duh!」Do you know what their fall specials are?
I sure do! That's right, I've already looked them up.Oh, and for an additional 150 yen, I can add a big ol' side of fried rice. Heh-heh-heh... Looks like I'm gonna get what I wanted, after all.Wh-Wh-WHAAAAAT!?!?

【Takeru】「This isn't right...」【Sumika】「Sure are a lot of people here today...」【Sumika】「Oh, look! A puppy! Look Takeru-chan, there's a puppy! Here boy! Heeere boy!!」

【Takeru】「ROAR!!」

【Sumika】「Hey!! What the heck was that for!?
You scared it away!!」【Sumika】「You're still whining about that...?」【Sumika】「Oh, come on. It'll be a nice change of pace.
Besides, I like this sort of thing.」【Sumika】「Then I guess you won't be needing this.
C'mere, doggie! Here boy!! I've got some food for you〜!」Do you think I'd seriously let you feed that to some mangy mutt!?【Sumika】「H-Hey... Come on, now. Sit down and chew your food.」【Sumika】「See? ...Here, drink some tea!」【Sumika】「That's what you get for acting stupid!
Come on, sit down.」【Sumika】「Oh, the dog's back! C'mere, little guy...」【Sumika】「Hey Takeru-chan, can I give it your fries?」【Sumika】「Here ya go〜!」【Takeru】「Grrrrrrrrrrrr...」

No!! Not my fries!!Why? Why must you punish me so!?【Takeru】「My fries... My precious fries...」【Takeru】「S-Sumika...」【Sumika】「But y'know? We haven't sat down and had a meal together like this in a while, have we?」【Takeru】「...When was this?」【Sumika】「Remember? We used to eat at that park...? The one by our houses...?」【Sumika】「I still think that's a gross name...」【Takeru】「Oh, save it.」【Takeru】「And therefore, it is your duty to bear that name for the rest of your life.」【Sumika】「I'm pretty sure they did that a while ago.」When we were kids, they had this slide that was shaped like a rocket,
and it went around in circles as you slid down.But now, even that's gone, and the one that replaced it is just your average, run-of-the-mill slide.【Sumika】「But I still see kids playing in that sandbox, every now and then.」【Takeru】「I did my fair share of nasty stuff in that thing, back in the day. Digging holes and peeing in them, burying dog turds, putting frogs into forced hibernation... The works.」Why are you wiping your hands on my shirt!?【Sumika】「So was I, until you completely ruined it... you dork.」【Takeru】「Hmph. It's childish and charming and you know it.」To be sure, I spent an awful lot of time playing in that park when I was in preschool.In fact...【Sumika】「You can't have any.」【Takeru】「Don't want any.」

【Takeru】「......」【Takeru】「Hey, back in that sandbox, did you and I... um... Do you remember if we made some sort of promise about something?」──You're gonna be my bride.【Sumika】「Why's your face all red...?
What kind of promise was it?」【Takeru】「Trust me, you don't wanna know.」【Sumika】「I mean, you've made a ton of promises with me, and you haven't followed through on a single one!」【Sumika】「You promised you were gonna introduce me to an alien, and that you were gonna give me a huge stuffed animal on my birthday, and also...」【Takeru】「I told you, just forget about it!!」【Sumika】「......Okay.」

Hm?Something's hitting my window.
...Oh, must be Sumika.

【Sumika】「Ahahaha... Sorry, I thought you couldn't hear me...」Don't "you'll get over it" me.【Sumika】「You're smirking.」【Sumika】「......」【Sumika】「Have I...?」【Sumika】「Well, congrats.」【Sumika】「...*sigh*...」【Sumika】「No, it's not that... But anyways — today was pretty fun, wasn't it?」【Sumika】「You didn't have fun, Takeru-chan?」2. I'll never forgive that damn dog!

【Takeru】「...I'll never forgive that damn dog!」【Takeru】「Of course I'm not! He totally devoured my fries. And then he started growling at me with those beady little eyes of his, remember?」【Takeru】「That cuteness is a facade!
You're being deceived!」【Takeru】「Their eyes... Their twisted, little eyes... They're all ferocious, wild animals!!」【Takeru】「Anyway! The next time I see that feral beast,
I'm gonna give it a taste of its own medicine!」【Takeru】「It's a dog-eat-dog world out there, you know!! Don't be so apathetic!!」【Takeru】「Hm? ...Now that you mention it, I never asked.」

【Sumika】「I can't believe you...」

【Sumika】「I'm still gonna come wake you up tomorrow, you know?」【Sumika】「Doesn't matter! I'm gonna come and wake you up, and that's final!!」【Takeru】「Oh reeeally?」【Takeru】「Oh-ho! Give it your best shot!」【Takeru】「Wh-What...?」【Sumika】「You'd best not forget those words.
Heh-Heh-Heh! Okay, g'night〜!」【Takeru】「Wha-... Hey...!」
......Now, time for a long and satisfying video game marathon.
Valgern-On, here I come...Unfortunately, no matter how good the console version is, playing on a controller leaves a lot to be desired.Man... I only bought the Dreamcost for this one game, but I still can't believe they already discontinued the hardware...I should've just bought one of those in the first place...

...Ugh, what do you want...?
...Just shut up already....Dammit, Sumika. Quit screaming out there...【Sumika】「Open this door and let me in, right this instant...
Waaah... You can't use the chain lock, that's no faaair...」【Sumika】「Mrs. Shirogane〜! I can't get in, even with the house key〜!」【Sumika】「This darn thing!!! I'm gonna get serious now!!」

...Phew. Back to bed.

*bang* *bang* *bang* *bang* *bang* *bang*...*bang* *bang* *bang* *bang* *bang* *bang* *bang*...

──Hm?

【Woman】「Such a rude awakening can hardly be beneficial to one's mental health.」...What?【Woman】「It seems my life here will not be an easy one, but so be it... I was prepared for this.」But... I'm... I'm not prepared to share a bed with you...【Sumika】「Alllrighty... this oughta do it...」【Sumika】「Yes! Takeru-chan!! I'm sure you're already awake by now, but I'm coming to wake you up anyway!!」【Woman】「*giggle*...What is the matter? You sound as though you've seen a ghost.」This is bad! I can hear Sumika skipping up the stairs!!Don't ask me why, but it's going to be bad if you come in right now! REALLY bad!!【Takeru】「Don't you dare get up!!」【Woman】「...Whyever not?」【Takeru】「No backtalk! Just stay put!!」【Sumika】「Ow-ow-ow... Jeez, that hurt.
What'd I ever do to you, stairs〜?」【Sumika】「Takeru-chaaan!」【Woman】「Ah...」I hide under the blanket with the unidentified woman.
I'll have to make something up and hope Sumika falls for it!!! There's no other way!!!【Sumika】「Are you stiiill in bed? Get up already!!」No, don't pull back the covers──!【Sumika】「...Huh?」【Sumika】「You know I can't do that...
You're gonna get up, whether you like it or not!」

【Sumika】「And I've sworn an oath to wake you up〜!」【Takeru】「I don't give a damn what you swore to do!」

【Takeru】「Well, I'm not going! Leave me alone!」Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!
Wh-Why are you talking!?Gyaaaaaaaaaaaah! Someone, please turn back tiiime!【Takeru】「...Ha Ha Ha Ha! Good morning, Sumika-kun. Nice weather we're having, don't you think?」【Sumika】「Awa... awa... awawawa...!」【Takeru】「Hrm. Well then, let's make a deal, shall we? I'm willing to pretend your forcible break-in to this residence never occurred.」【Takeru】「All I ask in return is that you turn a blind eye to the supernatural phenomenon you're currently witnessing...
More than a fair bargain, wouldn't you say!?」【Sumika】「......」【Sumika】「Whyyyyy, youuuuu...」

【Takeru】「Wait! Let's calm down and talk things over, shall we!? Only barbarians settle things with violence! Sto─」

【Sumika】「YOU BIG, STUPID IDIOT!!!」

*whoooosh*...

──*blam!*

【Takeru】「Maaadzooon!!」



【Sumika】「You're vile. You're sick. You're depraved...」【Takeru】「Just shut up and listen! How many times do I have to tell you!? I don't know her, either!!」【Takeru】「Whaaat!?」【Sumika】「Stupid-stupid-stuuupid! Stuuupid-stupid-stupid...」

【Sumika】「Owieee!!」

【Takeru】「Knock it off! You sound like a broken record! Besides, it has nothing to do with you!」【Takeru】「Oh yeah? How?」【Sumika】「Takeru-chan, you just hit me whenever you feel like it. Maybe that's why I'm so dumb.
It feels like my memory's gotten worse lately, too.」【Sumika】「Was delicious.」【Sumika】「Owieeeee!!」【Sumika】「Like I said, it's because you keep hitting me, Takeru-chan...」【Sumika】「...Don't be so mean. You know I'm bad at pop quizzes.」【Sumika】「Oh, you'll be fine.」【Takeru】「My mom's gonna be so mad at you when she gets back.」...【Takeru】「You know... This has kinda been bugging me for a while...」【Sumika】「You think? It's never really bothered me that much.」【Takeru】「Is it just me, or was that a poorly disguised insult?」【Sumika】「It is?」At least pretend like you're considering it, sheesh.【Sumika】「No means no.」【Takeru】「Sumika... I'm only gonna ask nicely one more tiiime...」【Sumika】「Owieeeee!!」【Takeru】「Sumikaaaaa!!!
You cheeky little punk! Who do you think you are!? Just shut up and give me the key!!」【Sumika】「No!! You can't have it!!」【Takeru】「Shut up! Give it back!
Give me back my freedom!」【Sumika】「No! Never! I wouldn't be able to come and wake you up anymore, Takeru-chan...」【Takeru】「That's a good thing!
I don't want you barging in like that!!」......【Sumika】「Hey... Why'd you stop...?」Even weirder, after Sumika knocked me into the stratosphere... I went back to my room, but she was gone...【Sumika】「What do you mean, 'spectral'〜?」──Not a problem at all!She was never there to begin with.【Sumika】「Oh, yes she was〜!」【Takeru】「Quit butting in on my inner thoughts!」【Takeru】「Oh, shut up.」Damn... She blocked it with her bag.【Sumika】「Heh-heh...! You won't be hitting me anymore, I'm afraid!」...You fool!

【Sumika】「Hwaaaaaaah!!」【Takeru】「Farewell, Sumika! And hello, freedom!」Something just came flying through the air and landed on my face... What is this thing?It's that doll Sumika always has dangling from her book bag. It's in a Santa suit all year round, for some reason... It's like a weird little... er... ummm...【Sumika】「Owieee... Jeez, I thought I was gonna die〜!」【Sumika】「Huh...? ...Ah!!」Sumika hurriedly snatches the doll out of my hand and starts checking it for damage.【Sumika】「Oh, thank goodness... It's still in one piece...」【Sumika】「He's Mr. Rabbit, for your information! And don't call him filthy!」【Sumika】「How 'bout... you buy me a new one, then?」【Takeru】「Huh? Why should I?」【Takeru】「Fine, suit yourself. Oh, and this conversation isn't over, by the way. Give me back my...」

S-Sumika... you... little...

I... I finally made it.Damn you, Sumika... Punching me right in the solar plexus...And I can't believe she actually went on without me!【Sumika】「Ahahahaha... I totally got you!!
You should've seen your face!! Ahahaha...」【Takeru】「H-Hey! Quit pulling!」【Sumika】「Well, you can't run well enough on your own right now, can you? You'll never make it if I don't pull you along.」【Sumika】「Yeah, yeah. C'mon, we've gotta go!!」【Takeru】「Wait, dammit!! H-Hey, I thought I told you to quit pulling──!」

【Sumika】「Huff... huff... Come on, Takeru-chan... Quit slothing around like that!」【Takeru】「*wheeze*...P-Pretty sure you mean 'stumbling.'」【Sumika】「No! I mean slothing — like a sloth!
Pick up the pace... Slothra.」【Takeru】「Pipe down, ya dumb slug.」【Sumika】「Gaaaaah!!! You owe slugkind an apology!」【Takeru】「Gyahahahahaha!! Do you even realize what you just said!?」【Voice】「Hey! Are you two just incapable of coming into class without making a huge scene of it!?」【Sumika】「Oh, morning, Sakaki-san.」【Takeru】「Sumika! Apologize!」【Class Rep】「Not her! You, Shirogane-kun!! You're the one who always bursts in here at the last minute every day, kicking up a huge racket...*sigh*...」【Class Rep】「You too, Kagami-san!」
